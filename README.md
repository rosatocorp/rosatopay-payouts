**Rosatopay's merchant payout sample code**

## Basic steps to start

In this Python code:

Replace 'YOUR_APP_ID' and 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY' with your actual App ID and Secret Key.

The generate_request_order_id() function generates a random order ID, similar to the other language versions.

The Rosatopay payout data is defined as a dictionary.

The requests library is used to send a POST request to the Rosatopay API with the specified headers and JSON data.

The response from the Rosatopay API is checked, and the result is printed to the console.

You can run this Python script in your Python environment to perform the Rosatopay payout operation. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual credentials and test the code accordingly.
